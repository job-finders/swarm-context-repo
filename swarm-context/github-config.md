## **How it Works**

* MCP (Model Context Protocol) is basically a **standard interface** for agents to fetch, update, and store context from external sources.
* If you set up an **MCP server** that talks to your GitHub repo, it can act as a bridge:

  * **READ**: Agents pull the latest context (Markdown spec files, plans, history) from the GitHub repo.
  * **WRITE**: Agents commit updated context files back to the repo.
  * **SYNC**: All agents always see the same “source of truth” because GitHub is the single shared context store.

---

## **Benefits**

* **Persistent history** — Git tracks every change automatically.
* **Concurrency control** — Branches & pull requests prevent overwriting.
* **Access from anywhere** — Agents can run locally or remotely.
* **Integration with CI/CD** — You could even trigger automated tasks when certain context files are updated.

## **Architecture**

```
[Agent: Kiro] \
[Agent: Kilocode] -> [MCP Client] -> [MCP Server: GitHub Adapter] -> [GitHub Repo]
[Agent: Cursor]  /
```

* **MCP Client** is the bit inside your agent runtime that talks MCP.
* **MCP Server (GitHub Adapter)** translates MCP calls into GitHub API calls:

  * `get_context(feature)` → Pulls `/features/<feature>/context.md` from main branch.
  * `update_context(feature, new_data)` → Creates commit or PR with changes.
* Context files live in the repo exactly like your folder-based setup.

---

## **Implementation**

* You could adapt an existing **Git MCP server** if one exists, or write a tiny Python/Node MCP server that:

  * Authenticates with GitHub via a PAT (Personal Access Token).
  * Uses GitHub REST or GraphQL API to read/write files.
* Agents would interact with it through **standard MCP commands** like `readContext` and `writeContext`.

---

## **Possible Gotchas**

* **Commit noise** — Every small update becomes a commit, so you might want to batch commits.
* **Rate limits** — GitHub API has rate limits; agents doing lots of updates may need caching.
* **Merge conflicts** — If multiple agents write to the same file simultaneously, you’ll need either a lock file system or PR-based flow.

---

If you wanted, we could **hybridize** your current *folder-based context management* with GitHub-as-the-backend:

* Agents work locally in `/agentic-context/` folders.
* MCP server syncs those folders to GitHub automatically.
* This gives you **offline work** + **remote persistence** + **Git history**.
