### How this would work

1. **Create a dedicated repo** for your swarm’s context files.
   Example:

   ```
   github.com/your-org/agentic-context
   ```

   Inside it, keep the `/features/` and `/specs/` folder structure we discussed earlier.

2. **Give each agent a GitHub token**

   * Create a fine-scoped **Personal Access Token (PAT)** or GitHub App key with:

     * `repo` (read/write to the repo)
     * `contents:read` and `contents:write` scopes only

3. **MCP GitHub adapter** (lightweight)

   * MCP `readContext(feature)` → Calls GitHub REST API:

     ```
     GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/features/{feature}/context.md
     ```
   * MCP `writeContext(feature, data)` → Calls GitHub REST API:

     ```
     PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/features/{feature}/context.md
     ```

     with a commit message, new content (base64 encoded), and the `sha` of the previous version.

4. **Agents share context**

   * Every agent reads before starting work.
   * Every agent writes after finishing work.
   * GitHub’s commit history becomes your full change log.

### Why this works without hosting your own MCP server

* MCP is just a protocol for how the **agent runtime** asks for and updates context.
* The actual *server* that stores the data can be GitHub’s own — your adapter is just a translator.
* This means you get:

  * Built-in persistence
  * Access control (GitHub permissions)
  * Change history
  * Global availability

### Possible issues to plan for

* **Merge conflicts** if multiple agents write at the same time — best solved with one-context-file-per-feature and possibly branch-per-agent workflows.
* **Rate limits** — GitHub REST API gives 5,000 requests/hour per token, which is fine for most cases but needs batching if swarm is very chatty.
* **Commit spam** — You may want agents to commit only after a “chunk” of work, not every minor update.
